# TextOrganiser

TextOrganiser copies text in a file to other files based on flags, sentinel characters (\xy), at the front of the line.
It reads an ini file to build a dictionary to couple characters to files.

TextCopier copies text from anywhere to files based on the same flags.
It also adds the url of the site you copied from, if you're copying from a site.
Only Firefox at the moment.
Otherwise it'll add the window name.
It needs xclip and a keyboard shortcut.
I set Windows-Q to open update.sh.
